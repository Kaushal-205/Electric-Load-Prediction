## Introduction

Thank you for exploring our Electric Load Prediction project using Multivariate LSTM. This project aims to provide accurate predictions of electricity consumption, enabling better energy management and resource allocation.

## Project Overview

Our project involves:

- Developing a Multivariate LSTM model to predict electric load based on historical consumption patterns and influencing factors.
- Collecting and preprocessing data, including electricity consumption records and contextual features such as temperature, day of the week, and time of day.
- Training the model to learn complex relationships within the data and make accurate future predictions.
- Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Approach and Methodology

We chose the Multivariate LSTM model due to its ability to capture intricate patterns in time series data. LSTMs can learn long-term dependencies, making them suitable for electricity load forecasting.

## Data Collection and Preparation

- Gathered historical electricity consumption data and relevant contextual features.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data, including normalization and handling missing values.
- Created sliding windows to structure the data for LSTM input.

## Model Architecture

Our Multivariate LSTM model consists of multiple layers of LSTM units:

- Input layer: Receives historical consumption and feature data.
- LSTM layers: Capture patterns and dependencies in the data.
- Dropout layers: Prevent overfitting by introducing randomness.

## Training and Validation

- Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
- Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- Trained the model on the training data using backpropagation.

## Evaluation and Results

Our model demonstrated promising results:

- MAE and RMSE scores were significantly lower compared to traditional methods.
- Accurate load predictions can lead to efficient energy utilization and informed decision-making.

## Achievements and Applications

- Successful implementation of the Multivariate LSTM model for load prediction.
- Implications for various industries relying on precise energy forecasting.
- Potential for cost savings and improved resource allocation.
